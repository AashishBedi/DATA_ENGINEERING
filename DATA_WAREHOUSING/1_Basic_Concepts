DATA WAREHOUSING:
1. Data Lakes
2. Data Virtualization

Database(DB) != Data Warehouse(DW). 
Because DW is made on the top of database. DB is like a platform whereas DW is usage.

Data is copied not moved in DW. Data remains in the source file and it's copies are sent to the DW.

Data Warehouse should be:
1. Integrated
2. Subject oriented
3. Time variant
4. Non Volatile
Lastly, when we bring data to data warehouse we need to restructure and reorganize the data to make it more useful for analysis.

Q. Why to build a DW?
-> In order to support data driven decision making.
-> One stop shopping: data we need in a single space rather than scattered space.


Q. Difference between DW and Data Lake?
Data Warehouse: Optimized for structured data, fast query performance, and business intelligence. Data is cleaned and transformed before storage.

Data Lake: Stores raw, unprocessed data in its native format, suitable for a wide range of data types and big data analytics. Offers greater flexibility and scalability.


Q. Difference between DW and Data Virtualization?
->Data Warehouse:
Storage: Centralized, physical storage.
Data Handling: ETL process, structured data.
Performance: Optimized for fast querying.
Use Cases: Historical analysis, BI, reporting.

->Data Virtualization:
Storage: No physical storage; data remains in source systems.
Data Handling: Real-time integration, virtual layer.
Performance: Dependent on source systems; optimized with caching.
Use Cases: Real-time data access, data federation, agile analytics.


Data Sources -> Data Warehouse
in between this journey we have ETL(Extract Transform Load)
