Providing dimensional context:
-> by: "Sliced and grouped" by values of the entire dimension
-> for: one or more specific values from within the entire dimension

In data warehousing:
measurements = facts(Numeric and quantifiable)
dimensional context = dimensions

facts are just quantifiable unit.
In RDBMS we store these facts in a fact table. 
Fact != Fact Table
 
Fact Table:
In a data warehouse, a fact table is a table that stores the measurements, metrics, or facts related to a business operation. It is located at the center of a star or snowflake schema and is surrounded by dimension tables.

Dimensional Table:
A dimension table or dimension entity is a table or entity in a star, snowflake, or starflake schema that stores details about the facts. For example, a Time dimension table stores the various aspects of time such as year, quarter, month, and day.


eg. Product category, product family, product
In star schema: all dimensions in a single dimension table
In snowflake schema: all dimensional with separate dimension table


A DW fact can be:
-> Additive: can be added under all circumstances
-> Non-additive: margins, ratios, percentages, GPA
-> Semi-additive

Dimensional data = facts and dimensions, fact tables and dimension tables

RDBMS key types:
-> Primary vs foreign keys
-> Natural vs Surrogate keys
Natural keys travel from our source systems and are stored within dimension tables, but they should not be used for your primary keys
