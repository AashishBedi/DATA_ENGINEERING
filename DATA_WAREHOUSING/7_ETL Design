ETL design is composed of:
ETL architecture, Dimension & Fact table, SCD, Star & Snowflake Schemas


ETL best practise and guidelines:
Limit amount of incoming data to be processed in ETL
process dimension table before fact table
opportunities for parallel processing

ETL is tough for snowflake schema

Dimension Table Incremental ETL:
1. data preparation
[to prepare data we need change data capture techniques
I. Transactional data timestamps
ii. Database logs
iii. last resort: database scan and compare]
2.data transformation
[data value unification
data type and size unification
de-duplication
dropping columns
value-based row filtering
correcting known errors]
3. Process new dimension rows
4. process SCD type 1 changes
5. process SCD type 2 changes
